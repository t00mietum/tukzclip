# Requirements

This is a product backlog just for pre-v1.0.0 release. After that, bugs, features, and enhancements will be managed in Github Issues.

Sorted per the notes in [Template](#template).

- tukzclip: our own clipboard program. Keeps the clipboard after the app that copied closes, and bridges the Wayland and X11 clipboards.
	- ID: 2026101509021629
	- Type: Feature
	- Status: Queued
	- Opened: 20261015-090216
	- Opened by: t00mietum
	- Requirements:
		- A separate project under the tukzedo umbrella.
		- Named 'tukzclip'.
		- A program that shows up as an icon in the system tray.
		- By default, it does two things:
			- Keeps the clipboard contents in memory for a predefined length of time (default 60m).
			- Bridges Wayland and X11 clipboard.
		- Additional optional features, off by default:
			- Convert the contents to (UTF-8) text-only.
			- Run a command-line with the clipboard contents as the argument.
			- Keep a history a user-adjustable X slots long, and for at most Y minutes each.
			- Persist history between runs. (With a warning about secrets being on storage.)
	- Note: we need a clipboard bridge anyway, even if we weren't using Wayfire, because X11 has a "feature" (bug), where if you copy contents from say a text editor, then close that editor before pasting it somewhere, the clipboard contents disappear. This is "surprising", to say the least. Since a clipboard is "global" to a user's session and works between apps, you'd expect that closing the program doesn't clear it. I get that it might be due to "security concerns", but that is a total half-measure.
	- Note: Wayland does the same. The clipboard belongs to the app that set it, and is gone when that app exits.
	- Note: moved here from the lxqtukz backlog, where the paste bug (2026101417551800) led to it.

- Leak, memory, and static checks in CI/CD, for all code
	- ID: 2026101714414461
	- Type: Task
	- Status: Queued
	- Priority|Severity: Avg
	- Opened: 20261017-144144
	- Opened by: t00mietum
	- Requirements:
		- The checks cover first-party and third-party code. Vendored code is included.
			- On third-party code, run the leak, memory, and correctness checks named here, not style lints. Style findings in someone else's crate or module aren't ours to fix.
			- CodeQL reports only on source inside the database's root. For its run, vendor the dependencies into the tree first (`cargo vendor`, `go mod vendor`, unpacked sdists for Python).
		- Any report fails the test that made it.
		- Any leak is fixed. If the fix has to wait, it gets a backlog item, and the test that shows it turns the check off with that item's ID beside it.
		- A `--leakcheck` flag adds the slow checks:
			- CodeQL, from a pinned CLI run locally. No hosted service.
			- A soak test. It loops through the program's main actions headless, and fails if the heap at round 2N is larger than at round N by more than a set margin. The heap report is kept as a pipeline artifact.
		- Every tool is pinned and runs in the build container or lint image, never installed on the host.
		- Each new gate is watched to fail before it's trusted, by planting the leak it's meant to catch and seeing it go red.
		- Known-advisory scans run on every full run: `cargo deny check advisories` or `cargo audit`, `govulncheck`, and `pip-audit`. They cover third-party code only, which is the point.

- Leak, memory, and static checks in CI/CD, for Rust
	- ID: 2026101714414463
	- Type: Task
	- Status: Queued
	- Priority|Severity: Avg
	- Opened: 20261017-144144
	- Opened by: t00mietum
	- Parent ID: 2026101714414461
	- Requirements:
		- Safe Rust leaks only through `Rc` or `Arc` cycles, `mem::forget`, `Box::leak`, and collections that grow forever. Real leaks and memory errors come from `unsafe` and FFI, in our crates or in dependencies.
		- Every full run builds the whole test suite with AddressSanitizer and LeakSanitizer, in a build dir of its own.
			- `RUSTFLAGS=-Zsanitizer=address cargo +NIGHTLY test -Zbuild-std --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`.
			- That needs a dated nightly, pinned beside the stable toolchain. Sanitizers aren't stable.
			- Every crate built from source is instrumented, dependencies included.
		- If the code starts threads, every full run also builds the tests with ThreadSanitizer (`-Zsanitizer=thread`), in another build dir.
		- Every full run runs the test suite under Miri: `cargo +NIGHTLY miri test`. It catches undefined behavior in `unsafe` code, ours and dependencies', and fails on memory still allocated at exit.
			- It moves behind `--leakcheck` only if a full run measures too slow.
		- A heap-growth test with `dhat` in testing mode reads `dhat::HeapStats` at round N and 2N in-process. It's the soak test for a library with no main program.
		- clippy runs with `-D warnings`, plus `clippy::mem_forget` and `clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks`.
		- Every `unsafe` block has a `// SAFETY:` comment.
		- Traps:
			- Without `-Zbuild-std`, std isn't instrumented. ASan mostly copes, but TSan gives false reports.
			- Without an explicit `--target`, the sanitizer flags reach build scripts and proc macros, and the build fails in odd places.
			- LSan reports at process exit, so a leak fails the whole test binary, not one test. Rerun with `--test-threads=1` and a test-name filter to find which.
			- Miri can't call FFI and has limited file and network access. A test that needs them gets `#[cfg_attr(miri, ignore)]` with a one-line reason. It's not silently left out.
			- Miri doesn't count memory reachable from a `static` as a leak, so a cache in a static that grows forever passes. The soak test catches that.
			- heaptrack and dhat both see only the global allocator. A crate that maps memory itself, or a custom allocator, hides it.
			- ASan and TSan can't share a build, and heaptrack can't share one with either. The soak test uses a plain build.
	- Note: tukzclip is planned in Rust, per `design.md`. No code yet, so the gates go in with the first crate.

**Stop here for a next release**

## Template

- Notes:

	- Only use rows that you actually need or expect will be filled in. Always fill in the title, ID, Type, Status, Opened and Created by.

	- The ID is the local time to the hundredth of a second. Opened is when it was written down, which may differ. (Use a keyboard macro and possibly something like project 'zuid' to generate.)

	- Status values meaning: Testing means the fix is in and checks are running or still to run. Waiting on signoff means automated testing passed. Moot means something else changed that made it irrelevant. Canceled means it still applies but was decided against. Waiting for testing means the fix is in and waits on a long CI run or an outside test host. Can't reproduce means a real attempt to reproduce it failed.
		- An item with nothing left for a person to judge skips Waiting on signoff and goes straight to Done. `Clean up the backlog` in the directives says when.

	- As issues are worked, and statuses change, place them in correct sorting order within the list:
		- First by status: Waiting for answers, Waiting on signoff, Testing, Waiting for testing, Can't reproduce, Stalled, Started, Queued, Done, Deferred, Canceled, Moot
		- Then by severity|priority: Critical, High, Avg, Low
		- Then by type: Bugs, [not bugs together]

	- Rows marked [Bug] are for bugs only, and rows marked [Feature] for features and enhancements. Priority and Severity share one row and one scale. Priority is for a Feature or Enhancement, and Severity for a Bug. Children are not nested. They sit at the top level and point back with Parent ID.
